* Secret locations will have a random gate. Press E to enter the mysterious area
  
### Collectibles:
* Coin: Used to upgrade (I'm still thinking about upgrading equipment or skills)
* Chest: Earn items (equipment or skills)



## New knowledge learned and used in the game

This is a project that I did myself and learned on Youtube, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT. Here are some Youtube channels I learned about and I really found them very easy to understand: Pix and Dev, bendux, bendux, Daniel Wood, Rehope Games


* Learned and applied Virtual Camera in games
* Use Camera Bounds to limit the range the Virtual Camera targets
* Learn and use tile maps to build maps in the game
* Use savepoints so that when the player dies, they will return to the last saved location
* Use teleportation
* Control enemies to move from start -> end with arbitrary length
* Generates a health bar that is lost when it touches an enemy (like dark souls)
* Make AI enemy

## Unity version
It has been tested and developed on Unity 2022.3.35f1

## Note
### Currently the game is still in development, I'm still thinking about what the maps will be like and what the coins and chests are used for. If there are any errors in the game, please sympathize and give me feedback. Thank you very much!
